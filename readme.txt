== Description ==

Adds a bitcoin order form for "[Maps Marker Pro](http://www.mapsmarker.com/)" and a live currency converter for EUR to bitcoins. See a live demo at [http://www.mapsmarker.com/bitcoin](http://www.mapsmarker.com/bitcoin)

Please note that this plugin is not configurable via the WordPress admin backend! I shared this plugin for other developers in order to be able to easier build an own form by just customizing an existing plugin.

The Plugin uses live data from MT Gox to convert Bitcoin to real currency by using the API from at [http://btcrate.com/](http://btcrate.com/). Conversion from USD to EUR is done by using the API from XE.com.
